his is a common case but not at all an absolute truth. WGS84 is a specific model of the earth (an ellipsoid) that is very commonly used -- e.g., the GPS system uses it. Latitude and longitude in the context of WGS84 define a point on the surface of that particular ellipsoid. However, there's nothing preventing someone from choosing a different model of the earth -- a perfect sphere, for example -- and still using latitude & longitude to define coordinates within that model of the Earth.
