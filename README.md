# Transportation-Scrap-Docs.
This is a backup for all the documents that were used in the transportation project in syst 568. The folder is very noisy though in a sense that the most significant files are not highlighted. Hence what is there is a noise of all the file that have been used and have not been used generally through out the project.


There are 2 main maps that has all the visulizations needed 
===========================================================
WMATA: Metro Layers on this map were taken originally from this source : Census Bureau, Esri, WMATA. This map has the zones in lat and lon points, coverage of the zones area and the metro stations lat and lon locations and coverage area.

Zones_2 : This map has the 200 active zones that are within a 100 miles range from every metro stations marked in green on the map. These zones are the main zones that will be used in the regrssion study.

Calcualtion
===========
In addition to visual presentation of the problem , also the nearest distance zones calcualted using a function called generate nearest distance on ArcMap in the proximity analysis tools under the header system tools in the catalouge. This function allows to specify the number of zones and the distance from each metro station.

1 Main Excel File
=================
The excel fiel 86 stations 200 zones, contains 86 stations as the name suggests with the nearest 200 zones within a 100 miles range.
